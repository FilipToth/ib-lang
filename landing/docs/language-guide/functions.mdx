# Functions

Here you will learn about functions, which provide a way for the user to reuse parts of the code and
structure it in a more re-usable manner. A function is esentially a pointer to a piece of code. Calling
the function executes the piece of code (function body) that the function is pointing to (moves the instruction pointer).

## Defining Functions

You can define a function in the following way:

```python
function my_func()
    output "Hello, World!"
end
```

The function can then be called, which executes its inner function body. Doing `my_func()` will result
in `"Hello, World!"` getting printed to the standard output. Functions are usually created to re-use repetitive
components of your code.

## Function Parameters

Functions can also take in parameters, much like mathematical functions. Parameters establish local
variables in the function body, and when calling the function, each argument corresponds to
a parameter in the function.

```python
function my_func(text: String)
    output text
end
```

This establishes `text` as a parameter of type `String` and declares the `text` variable in the
local function scope, thus it can be used in the function body. Then, when calling the function,
you must supply an object of type `String` in the call expression: `my_func("Hello")`.

:::tip Untyped Parameters
You also don't have to provide a type annotation when declaring a parameter in the function.
The parameter will have a type of `Any`.
```
function my_func(text, another_parameter: Int) end
```
:::

## Function Returns

Functions can also be defined to return a value. After executing a function, the call expression will resolve
into a value of the type of the function return.

```python
function my_func(x: Int) -> Int
    return x * 2
end
```

This defined a function that takes in an integer value and returns the doubled value. Thus, calling
`my_func(4)` will result in `8`. Doing `output my_func(2)` will print `4` to the standard output. Note that
function returns will always have to have an explicit type annotation (you can use the `Any` type). The
return then exits the execution of the function body.

## Recursion

IBL also supports function calling themselved out of their function body (recursion).

```
function my_func(i: Int)
    if i > 50 then
        return
    end

    my_func(i + 1)
end
```

:::danger Infinite Recursion
Recursing a function without any break-outs of the recursion loop will result in infinite
recursion and will trigger a runtime error.
