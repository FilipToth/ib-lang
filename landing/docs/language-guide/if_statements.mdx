# If Statements

Here, you will learn about if statements, which provide a way to run code conditionally.

## Defining If Statements

You can define an if statement in the following way:

```python
if x > 50 then
    output x + 10
end
```

The if statement will evaluate the code inside of the block `output x + 10` if and only if the condition `x > 50` is true.

## If-Else

You can use an else condition to run a code block if the condition in the `if` is false.

```python
if x > 50 then
    output "x is greater than 50"
else
    output "x is lesser than or equal to 50"
end
```

If `x` has a value lesser than or equal to `50`, the else condition will run.
