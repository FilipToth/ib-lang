# Variables

Here, you will learn about variables, which are objects that store a value inside of them and can be referenced or assigned to in your code.

## Creating Variables

You can create a variable by simply giving it a name and a value.

```python
my_variable = 100
```

This assign the value `100` to `my_variable` in the current scope (which you will learn about later).

## Referencing Variables

You can reference the value of the variable by simply typing its name, which will be treated as the value.

```
output my_variable + 100
```

This will print `200` to the standard output.

## Re-assigning Variables

:::tip Comments
`#` represents a comment, the rest of the line following a `#` will be ignored.
:::

You can re-assign a variable by simply re-initializing its value.

```python
my_variable = 100
output my_variable # will print `100`

my_variable = 200
output my_variable # will print `200`

my_variable = my_variable + 1000
output my_variable # will print `1200`
```

:::danger Types
Once a variable has been implicitly initialized with a type, it cannot be re-assigned with a value that is of a different type.
The following example will result in an error:

```
my_variable = 100
my_variable = false
```

This will result in an error since `my_variable` has already been initialized with a value of type `Int`, thus cannot be assigned with a `Bool`.
