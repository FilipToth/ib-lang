# Collections & Arrays

Here you will learn about Collections & Arrays, which are objects in IBL that hold references
to multiple other objects.

## Creating Collections

You can create a collection in the following way
```python
col = new Collection()
```
Collections and arrays store items (elements) in an ordered manner, and one can append items to
a collection, remove items, or get the number of items in the collection. Collections also provide
a head for easy item access.

### Appending Items

Append items using the `addItem` method, which takes the item as a reference.
```python
col.addItem(123)
```
will append `123` to the collection. The item will be added as the last item in the collection.

### Empty-ness of Collections

You can check if a collection is empty with the `isEmpty` method.
```python
col = new Collection()
output col.isEmpty() # will print `true`

col.addItem(123)
output col.isEmpty() # will print `false`
```

### Head Pointer

A collection also implements a head pointer, which holds a reference to an item within the collection.
At first, the pointer will point to the first element in the collection, and you can get its value using the
`getItem` method.

```python
col = new Collection()
col.addItem("Hello")

output col.getItem() # Outputs "Hello", as the first col item
```

:::danger Empty Collections
If a collection is empty, calling the `getItem` method will result in a **runtime error**. This will
be patched in a later update.
:::

Calling the `getItem` method also increments the index of the head pointer, thus it moves onto the second value.
```python
col = new Collection()
col.addItem("Hello 1")
col.addItem("Hello 2")

output col.getItem() # "Hello 1"
output col.getItem() # "Hello 2"
```

One can also reset the head pointer, doing so will move the pointer to point to the first item in the collection.
One can also check whether the collection has a next element (element after the head pointer) with the `hasNext` method,
which returns a `Bool`. It's advised to check `hasNext` before calling `getItem` in order to avoid
runtime errors.

## Arrays

An array is similar to a collection in that it holds multiple objects, but an array doesn't have
a head pointer. You can initialize an array in the following way:

```python
arr = new Array()
```

### Adding Array Elements

You can add elements to an array with the `push` method, which takes the element as an argument,
and works similarly to the `addItem` method in the `Collection` type.

```python
arr.addItem("I am an Array Element")
```

### Accessing Array Elements

To get an element from an array, you will need to know its index - or the position of the element
within the array. Then, you can use the `get` method, which takes the index as an argument,
to get the element out of the array.

```python
arr = new Array()

arr.push("Element 1")
arr.push("Element 2")
arr.push("Element 3")

output arr.get(1) # prints "Element 2"
output arr.get(2) # prints "Element 3"
output arr.get(0) # prints "Element 1"
```

You can also get the number of elements in an array using the `len` method, which returns
an `Int` representing the number of elements. E.g. calling `arr.len()` in our example would
return `3`.


## Generic Parameters

You can also enable type checking for collections and arrays using generic parameters. Previously,
the `get` and `getItem` methods returned an object of type `Any` and the `push` and `addItem` methods accept
an argument of `Any`. Stating a generic parameter when declaring an array or a collection will enable type checking
and make sure that these methods accept an argument of a type that matches that of the generic parameter.

```python
# create a string array
# push will take an argument of `String` and
# get will return an object of type `String`
col = new Array<String>()

# create a string collection
# addItem will take an argument of `String` and
# getItem will return an object of type `String`
col = new Collection<String>()
```
