# Basic Language Features

Here, we will go over the most basic features of the IB Pseudocode.

## Types

Every object in IBL is assigned a type. This type determines what the object is allowed to do and what kind of value it can hold. IBL does include an `Any` type which means
type checking for the object is disabled and the object doesn't have a determined type. It is reccomended to explicitly type all parameters and returns in IBL (more on that later).
The basic types in IBL include:

-   `Int` - represents an integer (a whole number).
-   `String` - represents a sequence of characters, i.e. text.
-   `Boolean` - represents a `true` or `false` value.
-   `Array`, `Collection`, `Stack`, `Queue` - these types represent objects that hold other objects inside of them, you can learn more about these in a later chapter.
-   `Void` - this type represents a value return by a function that doesn't return anything, i.e. void.
-   `Any` - represents any type, disables type-checking.

## Operations

You can perform binary operations between any two objects, this will then evaluate into a resultant object.

-   Addition - Use the `+` operator to add two numbers, `1 + 3`.
-   Subtraction - Use the `-` operator to subtract two numbers, `10 - 30`.
-   Multiplication - Use the `*` operator to multiply two numbers, `5 * 9`.
-   Division - Use the `/` operator to divide two numbers, `10 / 3`. Note that IBL currently does not support floating point numbers, so all numbers are treated
-   Comparison - Use the `>` or `<` operators to compare two numbers. The `a < b` expression checks if `b` is greater than `a` and the `a > b` checks if `a` is greater than `b`. Returns a boolean (`true` or `false`) value.
-   Equality - Use the `==` operator to check if any two objects are equal in value (it's implemented for all types): `10 == (5 + 5)`, will evaluate to `true` and `5 == (10 + 10)` will evaluate to `false`.

:::tip Floats

Note that IBL does not currently support floating point numbers, thus all numbers are treated as integers. The operation `10 / 3`, will result in `3` and not `3.3333...`

:::

You can also perform unary operation. These are operations that only apply to one object.

-   Negation - Use the `-` operator to create a negative number or negate an expression, `-10` or `-(10 + 30)`.
-   Logical Negation - Use the `!` operator to negate a boolean object: `!false` will evaluate to `true`, `!true` will evaluate to `false`, and `!(false || true)` will evaluate to `false`.

## Execution (Control Flow)

Execution in IBL happens sequentially. The root of any module (file) are statements, which are executed sequentially. E.g. in the following code:

```python
output 1 + 10
output false
```

The evaluator will execute `output 1 + 10` and then move onto the next statement (`output false`). In further chapters, you will learn about statements (functions, loops) that alter the control flow.
