# Loops

This document elucidates the use of loops in IB Pseudocode, a fundamental construct for controlling program execution flow by iterating over code blocks multiple times.

## For Loops

The `for` loop in IB Pseudocode enables deterministic iteration over a specified range of values. The syntax is as follows:

```
loop for index from 0 to 10
    my_variable = index * 2
    output my_variable
end
```

This construct executes the code block enclosed between `loop` and `end` exactly 10 times. On each iteration, the variable `index` assumes the current value within the specified range. It is noteworthy that the range is non-inclusive of the upper bound; hence, the loop iterates for index values `0, 1, 2, ..., 9` but excludes `10`.

## While Loops

The `while` loop facilitates iteration contingent upon a specified condition. Its syntax is illustrated below:

```
x = 0
loop while x < 10
    output x
    x = x + 1
end
```

In this example, the loop evaluates the condition `x < 10` prior to executing the code block. If the condition evaluates to `true`, the block is executed; otherwise, the loop terminates. This mechanism ensures that the loop executes only as long as the condition remains satisfied.

## Break

The `break` statement offers a mechanism for premature termination of a loop. Upon execution, it immediately redirects the program’s instruction pointer to the first statement following the loop construct.

```
loop while true
    rand = random(0, 10)
    if rand == 5 then
        break
    end
end

output "Hello!"
```

In this instance, the loop generates random numbers between 0 and 9 until the value `5` is produced. At this juncture, the `break` statement halts the loop, and the program proceeds to output `"Hello!"`.

## Continue

The `continue` statement allows the loop to skip the current iteration and advance directly to the next cycle. This is particularly useful for bypassing specific cases within an iterative process:

```
loop for i from 0 to 10
    if i / 2 == 0 then
        continue
    end

    output i
end
```

This code omits iterations where `i / 2 == 0`, thereby outputting only odd numbers.

:::tip Modulus Reminder
To determine odd or even numbers more effectively, the modulus operator is conventionally employed. However, the current implementation of IB Pseudocode does not support the modulus operator. In this example, integer division rounding behavior is leveraged as a workaround.
