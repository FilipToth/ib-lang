# Loops

Here, you will learn about loops, which are statements that alter the control flow of your code and run a code block multiple times.

## For Loops

A for loop can be defined in the following way:

```
loop for index from 0 to 10
    my_variable = index * 2
    output my_variable
end
```

This runs the code inside the block (the statements before the `end`) 10 times. For each iteration, it assigns the value of the iteration to a variable (in our case, it's called `index`). Note that the for loop is not right-inclusive, thus will not run for `index = 10`, and will only run for `0, 1, 2, ... 9`.

## While Loops

A while loop can be defined in the following way:

```
x = 0
loop while x < 10
    output x
    x = x + 1
end
```

This runs the code inside the block until the condition evaluates to `false`. The while loop evaluates the condition before each run, and evaluates the block if and only if the conditon is `true`.
