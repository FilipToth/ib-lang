# Stacks & Queues

Here, we will learn about Stacks and Queues, which are collection objects that store data in a
structured manner.

## Stacks

A stack holds elements like any normal collection. A stack can be created in the following way:

```python
stack = new Stack<String>()
```

You can add elements to the stack with the `push` method which expects an argument of the generic type.
Usage: `stack.push("Hello")`. You can also get items from the stack by calling the `pop` method, which
returns an object of the generic type. The `pop` method returns the last item added to the stack, and
adheres to the LIFO (Last In, First Out) ordering, it also removes the element from the stack.
```python
stack.push("Hello 1")
stack.push("Hello 2")

output stack.pop() # prints "Hello 2"
output stack.pop() # prints "Hello 1"
```
You can also get the number of elements in a stack using the `len` method, which returns an
object of type `Int`.

## Queues

A queue holds elements like any normal collection. A queue can be created in the following way:

```python
queue = new Queue<String>()
```

You can add elements to the queue with the `enqueue` method which expects an argument of the generic type.
Usage: `queue.enqueue("Hello")`. You can also get items from the queue by calling the `dequeue` method, which
returns an object of the generic type. The `dequeue` method returns the first item added to the stack, and
adheres to the FIFO (First In, First Out) ordering, it also removes the element from the queue.
```python
queue.enqueue("Hello 1")
queue.enqueue("Hello 2")

output queue.dequeue() # prints "Hello 1"
output queue.dequeue() # prints "Hello 2"
```
You can also check whether a queue is empty using the `isEmpty` method which returns a `Bool`
indicating whether the queue is empty.

:::danger Empty Stacks & Queues
Calling `pop` or `dequeue` on an empty stack or queue, will result in a **runtime error** and the module
will fail execution. It's recommended to check the `len` or `isEmpty` methods before executing `pop` or `dequeue`.
