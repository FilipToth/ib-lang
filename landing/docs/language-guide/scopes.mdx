# Scopes / Blocks

Here, we will introduce the idea of a scope.

## What is a Scope?

A scope is a context in which variables, functions, and other objects are defined. A scope contains variables and their values, and variables can only be accessed if defined
in the current scope (or in an above scope). Each module (file) defines a global scope which acts as a global context for variables and functions, which can be referenced
from everywhere in the file.

## Creating Scopes

A scope is created whenever a new code block is created. When declaring a for loop or a while loop, the code after the loop declaration and before the `end` is run within
a new scope.

```python
loop while true
    # new scope
end
```

When declaring an if statement, the body is also run within a new scope.

```python
if x > 50 then
    # new scope
end
```

Functions also evaluate their bodies in new scopes (but more on that later).

## Referencing Variables inside Scopes

The primary function of scopes is to separate variables and functions from different contexts. You cannot declare a variable inside of a scope and then use it outside of the scope.

```python
loop for index from 0 to 10
    output index # this is OK

    if index > 5 then
        output index * 2 # this is also OK, since index is defined in the parent scope
    end
end

output index + 1 # this is not OK and will result in an error, since index is defined in the loop scope
```

Same goes for user-defined variables.

```python
loop for index from 0 to 10
    my_var = index * 2
    if index > 5 then
        output index # this is OK
    end
end

output my_var # this will error
```
