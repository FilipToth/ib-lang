# Input / Output

Here, you will learn how to write to the standard output and get input from the user.

## Output

Printing to the standard output is simple, just use the `output` statement and pass any object as an argument (it accepts all types).

```python
output "Hello, World!"
output 1234 + 4567
output false && true
output my_variable
```

You can now look at the output box on the right to see the standard output (we set the `my_variable` variable to `2`).

## Input

You can get input from the user by calling the `input` function, which returns the user input (of type `String`).

```python
user_input = input()
output user_input
```
